# HW04codeQuiz

In this homework, we designed coding quizzes. 

Our Javascript elements power the HTML elements to create an interactive multiple choice timed quiz. 

There are ten questions regarding various coding elements.

There are 90 seconds to answer the questions.

Upon completion of the ten questions, or a lapse of time (whichever comes first) the user will be able to record their name or initials on the leaderboard.
